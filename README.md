# ML-EQE
This code is used to generate the ML model based on the data set. 
Each analysis and figure in the manuscript "Comparative Analyses of Data Driven Machine Learning Models for TADF Emitters" are generated by using this code.
Feel free to use this code and let me know if you face any problems!
